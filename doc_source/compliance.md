# Compliance validation for AWS App Mesh<a name="compliance"></a>

Third\-party auditors assess the security and compliance of AWS App Mesh as part of multiple AWS compliance programs, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\)\. App Mesh is a U\.S\. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \(HIPAA\) eligible service\. You can use App Mesh to manage communication between services that contain protected health information \(PHI\)\. HIPAA eligibility applies to all AWS Regions where App Mesh is available\. 

If you have a HIPAA Business Associate Addendum \(BAA\) in place with AWS, then you can use App Mesh for your HIPAA eligible workloads\. If you do not have a BAA in place with AWS, or if have any other questions about running HIPAA\-regulated workloads on AWS, then you can [contact an AWS businesss representative](https://pages.awscloud.com/compliance-contact-us.html)\. For information and best practices about how to configure AWS HIPAA eligible services to store, process, and transmit PHI, see the [Architecting for HIPAA Security and Compliance on Amazon Web Services paper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf)\.
