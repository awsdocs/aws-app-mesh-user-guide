# Virtual services<a name="virtual_services"></a>

A virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node directly or indirectly by means of a virtual router\. Dependent services call your virtual service by its `virtualServiceName`, and those requests are routed to the virtual node or virtual router that is specified as the provider for the virtual service\.

## Creating a virtual service<a name="create-virtual-service"></a>

To create a virtual service using the AWS CLI version 1\.18\.116 or higher, see the example in the AWS CLI reference for the [create\-virtual\-service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/appmesh/create-virtual-service.html) command\. 

**To create a virtual service using the AWS Management Console**

1. Open the App Mesh console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/appmesh/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh/)\. 

1. Choose the mesh that you want to create the virtual service in\. All of the meshes that you own and that have been [shared](sharing.md) with you are listed\.

1. Choose **Virtual services** in the left navigation\.

1. Choose **Create virtual service**\.

1. For **Virtual service name**, choose a name for your virtual service\. You can choose any name, but the service discovery name of the real service that you're targeting, such as `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`, is recommended to make it easier to correlate your virtual services to real services and so that you don't need to change your code to reference a different name than your code currently references\. The name that you specify must resolve to a non\-loopback IP address because the app container must be able to successfully resolve the name before the request is sent to the Envoy proxy\. You can use any non\-loopback IP address because neither the app or proxy containers communicate with this IP address\. The proxy communicates with other virtual services through the names youâ€™ve configured for them in App Mesh, not through IP addresses that the names resolve to\.

1. For **Provider**, choose the provider type for your virtual service:
   + If you want the virtual service to spread traffic across multiple virtual nodes, select **Virtual router** and then choose the virtual router to use from the drop\-down menu\.
   + If you want the virtual service to reach a virtual node directly, without a virtual router, select **Virtual node** and then choose the virtual node to use from the drop\-down menu\.
**Note**  
App Mesh may automatically create a default Envoy route retry policy for each virtual node provider that you define on or after July 29, 2020, even though you can't define such a policy through the App Mesh API\. For more information, see [Default route retry policy](envoy.md#default-retry-policy)\.
   + If you don't want the virtual service to route traffic at this time \(for example, if your virtual nodes or virtual router doesn't exist yet\), choose **None**\. You can update the provider for this virtual service later\.

1. Choose **Create virtual service** to finish\.
