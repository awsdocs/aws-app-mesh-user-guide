# Virtual services<a name="virtual_services"></a>

A virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node directly or indirectly by means of a virtual router\. Dependent services call your virtual service by its `virtualServiceName`, and those requests are routed to the virtual node or virtual router that is specified as the provider for the virtual service\.

## Creating a virtual service<a name="create-virtual-service"></a>

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**To create a virtual service using the AWS Management Console**

1. Open the App Mesh console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/appmesh/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh/)\. 

1. Choose the mesh in which you want to create the virtual service\. All of the meshes that you own and that have been [shared](sharing.md) with you are listed\.

1. Choose **Virtual services** in the left navigation\.

1. Choose **Create virtual service**\.

1. For **Virtual service name**, choose a name for your virtual service\. You can choose any name, but the service discovery name of the real service that you're targeting, such as `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`, is recommended to make it easier to correlate your virtual services to real services\. This way you don't need to change your code to reference a different name than your code currently references\. The name that you specify must resolve to a non\-loopback IP address because the app container must be able to successfully resolve the name before the request is sent to the Envoy proxy\. You can use any non\-loopback IP address because neither the app or proxy containers communicate with this IP address\. The proxy communicates with other virtual services through the names youâ€™ve configured for them in App Mesh, not through IP addresses to which the names resolve\.

1. For **Provider**, choose the provider type for your virtual service:
   + If you want the virtual service to spread traffic across multiple virtual nodes, select **Virtual router** and then choose the virtual router to use from the drop\-down menu\.
   + If you want the virtual service to reach a virtual node directly without a virtual router, select **Virtual node** and then choose the virtual node to use from the drop\-down menu\.
**Note**  
App Mesh may automatically create a default Envoy route retry policy for each virtual node provider that you define on or after July 29, 2020, even though you can't define such a policy through the App Mesh API\. For more information, see [Default route retry policy](envoy-defaults.md#default-retry-policy)\.
   + If you don't want the virtual service to route traffic at this time \(for example, if your virtual nodes or virtual router doesn't exist yet\), choose **None**\. You can update the provider for this virtual service later\.

1. Choose **Create virtual service** to finish\.

#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To create a virtual service using the AWS CLI\.**

Create a virtual service with a virtual node provider using the following command and an input JSON file \(replace the *red* values with your own\):

1. 

   ```
   aws appmesh create-virtual-service \ 
   --cli-input-json file://create-virtual-service-virtual-node.json
   ```

1. Contents of **example** create\-virtual\-service\-virtual\-node\.json:

   ```
   {
       "meshName": "meshName",
       "spec": {
           "provider": {
               "virtualNode": {
                   "virtualNodeName": "nodeName"
               }
           }
       },
       "virtualServiceName": "serviceA.svc.cluster.local"
   }
   ```

1. Example output:

   ```
   {
       "virtualService": {
           "meshName": "meshName",
           "metadata": {
               "arn": "arn:aws:appmesh:us-west-2:210987654321:mesh/meshName/virtualService/serviceA.svc.cluster.local",
               "createdAt": "2022-04-06T09:45:35.890000-05:00",
               "lastUpdatedAt": "2022-04-06T09:45:35.890000-05:00",
               "meshOwner": "123456789012",
               "resourceOwner": "210987654321",
               "uid": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
               "version": 1
           },
           "spec": {
               "provider": {
                   "virtualNode": {
                       "virtualNodeName": "nodeName"
                   }
               }
           },
           "status": {
               "status": "ACTIVE"
           },
           "virtualServiceName": "serviceA.svc.cluster.local"
       }
   }
   ```

## Deleting a virtual service<a name="delete-virtual-service"></a>

**Note**  
You can't delete a virtual service that is referenced by a gateway route\. You need to delete the gateway route first\. 

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**To delete a virtual service using the AWS Management Console**

1. Open the App Mesh console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/appmesh/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh/)\. 

1. Choose the mesh from which you want to delete a virtual service\. All of the meshes that you own and that have been [shared](sharing.md) with you are listed\.

1. Choose **Virtual services** in the left navigation\.

1. Choose the virtual service that you want to delete and click on **Delete** in the top right corner\. You can only delete a virtual gateway where your account is listed as **Resource owner**\.

1. In the confirmation box, type **delete** and then click on **Delete**\.
